# AI

* LLM models to explore:
    * google/gemini-2.5-flash
    * x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

* Prompt engineering
    * Zero-shot prompting - Direct commands without examples
    * One-shot prompting - Learning from a single example
    * Few-shot prompting - Multiple examples for consistency
    * Chain-of-thought - Step-by-step reasoning

* Vector DB: store embeddings

🎯 What are Vector Stores?
* Vector stores are specialized databases designed to:

    * Store embeddings (vectors) efficiently
    * Find similar vectors lightning-fast
    * Scale to millions of documents
    * Attach metadata for filtering
🔄 How Vector Search Works
1. Document → Embedding → Store in DB
2. Query → Embedding → Find Similar
3. Return Top K Results (by cosine similarity)

Example:
Query: "remote work policy" [0.2, 0.8, ...]
  ↓
Finds: "work from home guidelines" [0.21, 0.79, ...]
       (98% similar!)
⚡ Why ChromaDB?
Local-first: No cloud dependency
Production-ready: Used by real companies
Simple API: 5 lines to get started
Metadata filtering: Search by tags, dates, categories

🎯Transform your semantic search into a complete **RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** sytem that:
* RETRIEVE relevant documents (you built this)
* AUGMENTS with context
* GENERATE perfect questions

* ✂️ Advanced Chunking for RAG
* 🔄 Evolution from Vector Databases Lab:
* Vector Databases Lab Strategy
    * Fixed 500 chars
    * 100 char overlap

RAG Strategy
Paragraph-based
Semantic boundaries
* 📊 Smart Chunking Visualization:
Document: [=========================================]
* ↓ Split by paragraphs
    * Paragraphs: [Para 1] [Para 2] [Para 3] [Para 4]
* ↓ Add 20% overlap
    * Chunks: [Chunk 1: Para1 + 20%Para2 ]
    * [Chunk 2: 80%Para2 + Para3 + 20%Para4]
    * [Chunk 3: 80%Para4 + Para5 ]
* Why paragraph-based? Preserves complete thoughts for better context in generation!

* 🪜 What is LangGraph?
* LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-step AI workflows using graphs. Unlike simple LLM chains, LangGraph gives you explicit control over how data flows through your application, enabling complex decision-making, loops, and conditional 

* langgraph - Stateful graph framework
* langchain - Core LLM abstractions
* langchain-openai - OpenAI integration
* duckduckgo-search - Web search tool

⭐️ THE ESSENTIAL PIECES
* Before we dive in, let's understand what we'll be building with:

📦 Imports
• StateGraph (the container)
• END (marks completion)
• TypedDict (defines data)
⚙️ Nodes
• Python functions
• Take state as input
• Return partial updates
🔗 Edges
• Connect nodes together
• Define execution order
• Can be conditional
📊 State
• Data flowing through
• Shared between nodes
• Updated at each step

🎯 SIMPLE EXAMPLE
💠 Think of it like a recipe:
1. Ingredients (State) = Your data
2. Steps (Nodes) = Functions that transform data
3. Instructions (Edges) = "Do this, then that"
4. Recipe Book (StateGraph) = Puts it all together!

* What is MCP?
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol for connecting AI to external tools. Think of it as a USB port for AI - a standardized way for models to interact

* Build on Your LangGraph Knowledge
* Extend your LangGraph agents with MCP servers - from simple calculator tools to orchestrating multiple services.
